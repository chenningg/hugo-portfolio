# Contemplating life

It's said that there is no one out there in this whole universe except for us. That we, as humanity, are alone.
It's a very sobering thought to think that we could just be a blip in time and disappear for all eternity.
For all purposes and consequences, we are but expendable beings, doomed to walk for a little while and fade away in the cosmic noise.
For all intents and purposes, this universe is nothing more than a cage.
Sure, it's a cage that's large enough that you'll never explore its edges, but you have already claimed the best corner of the cage.
There is nothing else to see within the cage that doesn't consist of things that will kill you, or simply empty nothingness.
So what then? Should we wait in our happy little corner forever?
Or will we dream, and thirsting for freedom, break out of the cage?
Is it even possible? Will it ever be possible if we don't try?
The silence of the universe answers our unending questions.
As empty and desolate as it is, the only way to find out... is to leave.
